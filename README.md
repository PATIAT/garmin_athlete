# Athlete Exercise Data

......

With so much information available these days, it can be difficult to digest it all. Many of us find it easier to absorb the facts and figures through visualisation.

This website is a data dashboard of my personal exercise activities since 2014 to part way through this year, 2017. All of the activities whether running, cycling or
swimming were recorded on a Garmin GPS Smartwatch. The data was downloaded from the Garmin Connect website in csv format.

Having been in or around the running, cycling and swimming scene for many years I feel I have a good grasp of what metrics and measurements the average fitness
enthusiast wants to see from their Smartwatch or GPS generated data.

## Technologies
